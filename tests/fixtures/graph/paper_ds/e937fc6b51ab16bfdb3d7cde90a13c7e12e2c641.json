{"abstract": "A. Wald has presented a model of production and a model of exchange and proofs of the existence of an equilibrium for each of them. Here proofs of the existence of an equilibrium are given for an integrated model of production, exchange and consumption. In addition the assumptions made on the technologies of producers and the tastes of consumers are significantly weaker than Wald's. Finally a simplification of the structure of the proofs has been made possible through use of the concept of an abstract economy, a generalization of that of a game. Introduction L. Walras [ 24 ] first formulated the state of the economic system at any point of time as the solution of a system of simultaneous equations representing the demand for goods by consumers, the supply of goods by producers, and the equilibrium condition that supply equal demand on every market. It was assumed that each consumer acts so as to maximize his utility, each producer acts so as to maximize his profit, and perfect competition prevails, in the sense that each producer and consumer regards the prices paid and received as independent of his own choices. Walras did not, however, give any conclusive arguments to show that the equations, as given, have a solution.", "arxivId": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "7697925", "name": "K.
