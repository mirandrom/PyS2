{"abstract": "In organizations, green creativity of the employees is an essential part of implementing sustainable development. Our research proposed that workplace status has a significant impact on green creativity. Through an empirical study, we came to the conclusion that an increase in workplace status can lead to green creativity and prosocial motivation mediates the process. Since workplace status promotes the attention for group interests, employees will evaluate their self-worth considering the sustainable development of the environment. Based on the analysis framework of moderated mediation model, this study indicated that organization identification had a positive moderating effect on the relationship between workplace status and green creativity, and it is the boundary condition for workplace status to be effective.", "arxivId": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "47087489", "name": "Z.
