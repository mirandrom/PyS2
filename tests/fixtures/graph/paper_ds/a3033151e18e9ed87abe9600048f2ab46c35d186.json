{"abstract": "Forward-looking papers from around the globe, addressing themes of current educational practice, were published in the FEMS Microbiology Letters virtual Thematic Issue 'Learning for the future' in October 2019. Its dynamic content is reviewed here to facilitate discussions within the professional community. The focus is on preparing generations of 21st century professionals as lifelong learners for yet unknown working environments and demands. Active and authentic learning is covered in various contexts from interactive lectures, via innovative tasks exploring the scientific method to conducting research over a distance. Naturally, authentic assessment features. Moreover, authentic learning is taken out of the classroom into the community as service learning for students to develop skills and see unexpected STEM career opportunities. Approaches to public engagement with science are presented including through art. Art is also brought into the classroom, as well as educational games, to foster creativity. Additionally, sharing science with large audiences on social media is discussed. Future-proofing education requires being innovative and imaginative. This comes with challenges and risks, but being prepared is worth it.", "arxivId": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "7970821", "name": "B.
