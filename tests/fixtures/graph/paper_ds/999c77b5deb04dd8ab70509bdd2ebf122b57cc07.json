{"abstract": "Metabolomics has come of age and is predicted to have a compound annual growth rate of 30\u00a0% from 2014 to 2019 and a market value of $2.1 billion by 2019 (Rohan 2014). While recent progress has been driven by technological advances in both analytical instrumentation and software, and by the availability of ring-fenced research funding in some countries, insufficient attention has focused on developing the specialist training required to support this growth. The international Metabolomics Society was established to promote the growth of this field (Goodacre 2005), to stimulate collaboration among scientists in academia, government and industry, and to deliver conferences and training workshops. ELIXIR-UK (http://elixir-uk.org/) is the United Kingdom node within the European ELIXIR infrastructure and currently focuses on bioinformatics training provision that will be delivered in specialised centres, through face-to-face courses and e-learning; this training will be in partnership with other European ELIXIR Nodes. To guide the development (and ultimately provision) of fit-for-purpose training, considering factors such as scientific content, expertise levels of attendees, knowledge level of course, and mechanisms by which to provide the training, the international Metabolomics Society and ELIXIR-UK have jointly conducted a global assessment of the training needs in metabolomics science. Specifically, a questionnaire was developed and widely distributed to determine the training needs of our international community, the training programs that already exist, the new course content to develop and the mechanisms by which this training could be delivered. By \u201cmetabolomics science\u201d, we include the underpinning science and technology (experimental design, analytical measurements, computational analyses and informatics) and any field of application from microbes to plants and animals, including humans. Here we report the results of the training needs questionnaire, from which we have derived a series of key recommendations to support the training of the growing metabolomics community. By sharing the full results, we hope that others will conduct additional analyses and be able to derive further interesting conclusions, and collectively help to guide the development of metabolomics training programs globally.", "arxivId": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2073815", "name": "Ralf J.
