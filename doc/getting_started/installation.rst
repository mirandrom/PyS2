Installing S2Py
===============

S2Py supports Python 3.6+. The recommended way to install S2Py is via ``pip``.

.. note::

    Depending on your system, you may need to use ``pip3`` to install packages for
    Python 3.

.. warning::

    Avoid using ``sudo`` to install packages. Do you `really` trust this package?
